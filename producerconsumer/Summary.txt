Results summary:
Each test case was tested with four combinations of sleep times (30/60, 50/50, 50/100, 100/50). 
The results reveal the on average, increasing the number of producers and/or consumers increases throughput.
1 producer, 1 consumer:	~309–361
4 producers, 4 consumers:	~789–1512
16 producers, 16 consumers:	~3101–5929
Shorter sleep times lead to higher activity and more items produced and consume. Longer sleep times do the opposite.
Having only one producer or consumer tends to create a bottleneck. The difference between 1 producer+16 consumers and 1 producer+1 consumer isn't very much with balanced sleep times.
Having more consumers doesn't help if the producer can't produce enough resources to make use of all the consumers.
Throughput scales with resources. See 16+16 producers and consumers at 50 ms vs 1+1 with the same conditions.
